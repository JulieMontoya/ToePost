# Building ToePost

ToePost is written in [BeebASM](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm/tree/master).  This is a bit
perverse, what with BeebASM being specific to the BBC Micro and ToePost being a PET program; but
"Beeb flavour" 6502 assembly language is the syntax I learned nearly 4 decades ago, and I know I
would have spent far too long cursing the "un-BBC-like" syntax of any other assembler.
